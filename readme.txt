#So this is a couple of R markdown documents used to simulate and compute the distributions of outcomes of rolls in the tabletop wargame "Warhammer 40k" 10th edition. Most of my efforts lie in the "gun vs thing"-file which simulates the dice rolling. The "Scorpions"-file contains some explicit calculations of expected outcomes. The framework in the markdown documents should make it clear how to adapt the work to different situations.
